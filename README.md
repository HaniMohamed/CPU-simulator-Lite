## Available Commands(Assembly Instructions):
- ### Two operand Commands:

| Inst.         | Describe                                                                       |    
| ------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| ADD           | add value of 2nd operand from value of 1st operand.                            |
| SUB           | subtract value of 2nd operand from value of 1st operand.                       |
| MOV           | transfer value from 2nd operand to 1 operand.                                  |
| BNZ           | if value of 2nd operand is not zero branch to location of value of 2nd operand.|

ADD	; add value of 2nd operand from value of 1st operand.
SUB	; subtract value of 2nd operand from value of 1st operand.
MOV	; transfer value from 2nd operand to 1 operand.
BNZ	; if value of 2nd operand is not zero branch to location of value of 2nd operand.
